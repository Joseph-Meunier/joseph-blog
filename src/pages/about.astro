	<p>
		Welcome to my blog! 👋 I'm a junior developer passionate about Flutter 🧩, C# with .NET, and public speaking 🎤. Curious and always eager to learn 📚, I'm also aiming to make a good living 💰.
	</p>
	<p>
		💡 Currently in my final year of studies 🎓, I specialize in custom application design, with a focus on low-code / pro-code, automation 🤖, and user experience 🎯. I'm exploring Flutter for cross-platform mobile development and C# with .NET for robust backend solutions.
	</p>
	<p>
		🧠 My final-year project focuses on the impact of AI in software development, particularly on the relationships between business teams and developers, tools like copilots, intelligent agents, and their integration into professional environments 🏢.
	</p>
	<p>
		🚀 Through this blog, I share my learnings, projects, and favorite tools 🛠️. My goal: to connect, grow, and contribute to the developer communities 🫶.

		Oh, and by the way — that's not my real photo, just so you know 😄
