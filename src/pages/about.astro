		Welcome to my blog! 👋 I’m a junior developer passionate about Symfony 🧩 and public speaking 🎤. Curious and always eager to learn 📚, I'm also aiming to make a good living 💰.
	</p>
	<p>
		💡 Currently in my final year of studies 🎓, I specialize in custom application design, with a focus on low-code / pro-code, automation 🤖, and user experience 🎯. I’m also exploring Symfony development to create web applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		🧠 My final-year project focuses on the impact of AI in software development, particularly on the relationships between business teams and developers, tools like copilots, intelligent agents, and their integration into professional environments 🏢.
	</p>
	<p>
		🚀 Through this blog, I share my learnings, projects, and favorite tools 🛠️. My goal: to connect, grow, and contribute to the Symfony community 🫶.

		Oh, and by the way — that’s not my real photo, just so you know 😄
