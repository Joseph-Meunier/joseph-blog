## How to write a REST API?

A **REST API** (for *Representational State Transfer*) is a means of communication between different applications, often between a client (browser, mobile app, etc.) and a server. It allows the manipulation of **resources** (data) through well-defined **URLs**, using **HTTP verbs**.

### Example: SWAPI

Let's take the example of the [SWAPI](https://swapi.info/) API, a public API that provides data from the Star Wars universe. 
Here's a typical URL: https://swapi.info/api/films.

#### Let's break down this URL:

- **https**: The protocol used is `HTTPS` (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure). It enables communication between a client and a server, with a security layer (encryption).
- **://**: This separator immediately follows the protocol and precedes the domain name.
- **swapi.info**: This is the domain name of the server hosting the API.
- **/api**: This indicates that we're entering the "API" part of the site. This prefix is a commonly used convention.
- **/films**: This is the targeted resource. Here, we want to access Star Wars films.

The combination of this URL allows access, via a browser or HTTP request, to the list of available films.

### HTTP Verbs

A REST API relies on the use of **HTTP verbs**, which indicate the action we want to perform:

- **GET**: Read a resource (for example, retrieve the list of films).
- **POST**: Create a new resource (e.g., add a user).
- **PUT**: Update an existing resource.
- **DELETE**: Delete a resource.

In our example:

```http
GET https://swapi.info/api/films
```

This means: "I want to retrieve (GET) all available films from the SWAPI."

### Response Format

REST APIs often return responses in JSON format. Here's a simplified example of a response you might get:

```json
{
  "count": 6,
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "A New Hope",
      "episode_id": 4,
      "release_date": "1977-05-25"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

This format is easily readable by programs and can be used to display data in an application or website.

### In Summary

A REST API uses clear URLs and HTTP verbs to enable resource manipulation. Thanks to this simple and standardized operation, it facilitates exchanges between computer systems. Whether you're a web or mobile developer, knowing how to consume a REST API is a fundamental skill!
