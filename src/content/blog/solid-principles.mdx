## SOLID Principles

The **SOLID principles** are a set of five design principles that help developers create maintainable, scalable, and robust software. They were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and are widely used in object-oriented programming.

### S - Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one responsibility.

For example, a class that handles user authentication and authorization should be split into two classes: one for authentication and one for authorization.


### O - Open/Closed Principle

A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

For exemple, a dog 



### L - Liskov Substitution Principle

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

### I - Interface Segregation Principle

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Conclusion

The principles help to create a more maintainable, scalable, and robust software, but it can be difficult to respect them all at the same time.
