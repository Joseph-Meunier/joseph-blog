## What is OOP?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code to manipulate that data.

Let's take the example of an animal.

Before, if we didn't use OOP, we would have code like this:

```csharp
var animalName = "John";
var animalAge = 2;

var animalName = "Jane";
var animalAge = 7;
```

But now, if we use OOP, we would have code like this:

```csharp
var animal = new Animal();
animal.Name = "John";
animal.Age = 10;

var animal2 = new Animal();
animal2.Name = "Jane";
animal2.Age = 6;
```

This allows us to create objects who can be instantiated and have properties and methods.

### Class

A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
It defines the properties and methods of an object.

```csharp
class Animal {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

### Object

An object is an instance of a class.
It has the properties and methods of the class.

```csharp
var animal = new Animal();
```

### Instantiation

Instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class.

```csharp
var animal = new Animal();
```

### Properties

Properties are variables that belong to an object.
In our example, the properties are `Name` and `Age`.

```csharp
animal.Name = "John";
animal.Age = 10;
```

### Methods

Methods are functions that belong to an object.
In our example, we can add the methods `Eat`, `Sleep`, and `MakeSound`.
We can also see that we can access the properties of the object in the methods.


```csharp
class Animal {
    private string name;
    private int age;

    public void Eat() {
        Console.WriteLine($"{name} is eating");
    }

    public void Sleep() {
        Console.WriteLine($"{name} is sleeping");
    }

    public void MakeSound() {
        Console.WriteLine($"{name} is making a sound");
    }
}
```



## The 3 Principles of OOP

In OOP, we have 3 principles:

1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the principle of encapsulating the data and methods of an object.
This allows us to protect the data and methods of an object by making them private.
It also makes the data and methods of an object easier to maintain and test.

In our example, we have encapsulated the data and methods of an object.
The properties are private and the methods are public.
```csharp
class Animal {
    private string name;
    private int age;

    public void Eat() {
        Console.WriteLine($"{name} is eating");
    }

    public void Sleep() {
        Console.WriteLine($"{name} is sleeping");
    }

    public void MakeSound() {
        Console.WriteLine($"{name} is making a sound");
    }
}

var animal = new Animal();
animal.Name = "John";
animal.Age = 10;

animal.Eat();
animal.Sleep();
animal.MakeSound();
```

If we execute it, we get the following result:
```csharp
"John is eating"
"John is sleeping"
"John is making a sound"
```


### Inheritance

Inheritance is the principle of inheriting data and methods from an object.
This allows us to create a class that inherits properties and methods from another class.
This allows us to reduce code duplication and make the code easier to maintain, read, and test.

If we take our example again, we can create a `Dog` class and a `Cat` class that inherit from the `Animal` class.

```csharp
class Dog : Animal {
    public override void MakeSound() {
        Console.WriteLine($"{name} is barking");
    }
}

class Cat : Animal {
    public override void MakeSound() {
        Console.WriteLine($"{name} is meowing");
    }
}

```
We can see that the `Dog` class and the `Cat` class inherit from the `Animal` class and that the `MakeSound` method is redefined (it is overridden) in the `Dog` and `Cat` classes.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the principle of polymorphizing the data and methods of an object.
This means that we can use the same methods for different objects.

If we take our example again, we can create a `Dog` class and a `Cat` class that inherit from the `Animal` class and we can use the same methods for different objects.
Below, we create an `animal` object of the `Animal` class and we call the `MakeSound` method which is defined in the `Animal` class.
Then, we create a `dog` object of the `Dog` class and we call the `MakeSound` method which is defined in the `Dog` class.
Then, we create a `cat` object of the `Cat` class and we call the `MakeSound` method which is defined in the `Cat` class.

```csharp
var animal = new Animal();
animal.Name = "John";
animal.MakeSound();

var dog = new Dog();
dog.Name = "Rex";
dog.MakeSound();

var cat = new Cat();
cat.Name = "Whiskers";
cat.MakeSound();
```

If we execute it, we get the following result:

```csharp
"John is making a sound"
"Rex is barking"
"Whiskers is meowing"
```

## Abstract

We can also see that the `Animal` class doesn't really need to be instantiated.
An animal is necessarily of a species.
To prevent instantiation of the `Animal` class, we can make it abstract.

```csharp
abstract class Animal {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

```

## Conclusion

OOP is a programming paradigm that allows us to create objects that have properties and methods.
It makes the code easier to maintain, read, and test.
